# 📜 Praveenkumar.S – Code Whisperer, Bug Slayer, and Software Developer Extraordinaire

### 👋 About Me
Hey there! I’m Praveenkumar.S, a Software Developer at **Sophista Software Solutions** and a relentless tinkerer in all things code. I make the web prettier, apps smoother, and bugs a little more nervous every day. Armed with a keyboard and fueled by copious amounts of caffeine, I’m on a journey to turn complex ideas into seamless experiences.

### 👨‍💻 Professional Superpowers
- **Frontend Mastery**: Fluent in Angular, DotNet, Laravel, Electron.js, Ionic – if it’s about making an interface sparkle, I’m probably already on it.
- **API Wizardry**: Building slick web APIs is my jam! Currently crafting away on my pride and joy, **MyWebApiProviderApp**, with .NET 8.
- **Backend Fundamentals**: MySQL and some Apache know-how, for those days when I like to flex my server-side skills.
- **Currently Learning**: Nginx, Docker, WSL – because who doesn’t love more tools in the toolbox?

### 🛠️ Work Ethic (Translation: How I Code Without Losing My Mind)
- **All About the Details**: My project folder structures are so organized, Marie Kondo would be proud.
- **Elegant Code is King**: Aesthetic matters – and not just for the UI. I’m all about readable, efficient, and maintainable code.
- **Table Naming Ninja**: Every company in my API gets its own unique table. A neat little quirk that my data schema loves me for.

### 📈 My Aspirations
To one day become an independent tech pro, working with teams around the world and on my own terms. Oh, and to master unit testing without feeling like I’m battling the Code Hydra.

Certainly! Here’s an updated *Hit Me Up* section with a few more points to make it engaging:
